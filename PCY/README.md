Implementation of the a-priori and PCY algorithm.

A-priori algorithm is used to analysis shoping carts, and choose the products, which have the influence on each other, and their frequency of the existence is the highest. 

The PCY- algorithms is used to big data and streams, diffrent methodes used in algorithm help to save memory and nessesary disc-space (it use hashing and bitmaps).
PCY algorithm is used as optimized apriori algorithm for shopping-basket analysis, when we want to find relation betweens products.
